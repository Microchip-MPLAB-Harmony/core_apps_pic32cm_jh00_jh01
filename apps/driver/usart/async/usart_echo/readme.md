# USART driver asynchronous - UART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in Bare-Metal environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

### Setting up [PIC32CM JH01 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:
