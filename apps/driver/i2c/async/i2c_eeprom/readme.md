# I2C driver asynchronous - I2C EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM.

## Description

This example uses the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with the EEPROM to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment. This application uses I2C driver to read and write data from an AT24CM02 EEPROM device.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_pic32cm_jh01) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

### Setting up [PIC32CM JH01 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board
  - One [mikroBUS Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) boards

- Connect [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) to EXT3 header
- Plug the [EEPROM 3 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) into the MikroBus socket of the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [PIC32CM JH01 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/) | LED0 |
